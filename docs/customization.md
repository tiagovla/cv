# Customization

The `cv` class is designed to be minimal and easy to extend.

To customize the layout, fonts, or styling, edit the `cv.cls` file directly.

Some ideas for customization:

- Adjust page margins or spacing
- Change fonts or font sizes
- Modify header styles
- Add new environments or commands for extra sections

If you are familiar with LaTeX class files, you can extend or override existing macros to suit your needs.
