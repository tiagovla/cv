# Installation

To use the `cv` LaTeX class, follow these steps:

## Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tiagovla/cv.git
cd cv
```

## Usage

Make sure the `cv.cls` file is either:

- Located in the **same folder** as your `.tex` document, or
- Installed in your local TeX distributionâ€™s `texmf` tree.

You can now compile `.tex` files that use the `cv` class as usual with `pdflatex` or `xelatex`.
